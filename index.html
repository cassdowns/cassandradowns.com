                Cassandra Downs is a self-taught ceramic artist based in Naarm (Melbourne). She creates distinctive zoomorphic vessels of the unique native fauna of so-called Australia, whilst taking structural and technical influence from Pre-Columbian Peru. Her works are created with sustainably foraged materials, and a focus on traditional processes.

               Animals taking on unlikely forms is an ancient, enduring concept, and one which has led me to a lifetime of fascination for zoomorphic artifacts and their ethnographic connotations. 
</p><p>
Whilst developing my ceramic practice, I came upon the animal vessels of Pre-Columbian Peru, and since then have been driven to depict my native fauna in an emulation of these enigmatic, functional works.
</p><p>
To imbue them with a spirit of their own, I dedicate immense effort and time to each vessel - using traditional techniques, firing styles, and sustainably foraged materials. Their empty nature and evocative, minimalist silhouettes, provides the perfect opportunity for each observer to create their own stories, unbound by neither time, place nor language.

                I reside on the unceded lands of the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people of the Kulin nation, and I pay my repects to Elders past, present and emerging. This respect is extended to all First Nations people who may be viewing this. I am grateful for their continued custodianship over the animals and plants of this beautiful land, and hope for it one day to be properly restored.
