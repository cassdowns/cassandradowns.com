               Cassandra Downs is an Anglo-Australian and Stolen Generations affected woman living on Wurundjeri Country. She is a self-taught ceramic artist whose zoomorphic vessels explore the effects of colonisation on both the environment and identity of so-called Australia.
		</p><p>
Cassandra devotes months of labour into each vessel - from finding and processing the raw elements used, to the phoenix-like ceremony of the pit fire - shaping them into objects of meaning, life, and a connection to place and time. 
		</p><p>
Her focus on sustaining Country through foraged materials and traditional firing techniques leaves the story of her process etched into each sculpture, the healed cracks and textured surfaces act as a reminder of our responsibility to conserve the world we live in and those we share this space with.

                I reside on the unceded lands of the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation, and I pay my repects to Elders past, present and emerging. 
		    This respect is extended to all First Nations people who may be viewing this.
