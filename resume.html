                <p>
                In mid 2019 my contract with NAB was up for renewal, and though it was a risk, I chose to take a step back from the digital world to focus on my ceramic arts practice. 
                Since then, I feel a greater connection to my making process, and an appreciation for creating things with my hands which I've since passed along to personal digital works.

                    <h3>Design Systems</h3>
                    <p>My recent roles have been dedicated to creating consistency and working towards design / development parity. This has involved the mammoth task of uphauling an existing
                        set of design patterns and moving to componentry, as well as creating a design system from nothing. For future roles, I'm most interested in these kinds 
                        of challenges - there's nothing more satisfying than building the systems in which both creative and technical teams can shine.</p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>I have a tremendous passion for creating products accessible to all. From ensuring colourblind users can see buttons, to reducing stress for 
                        those with mobility impairments, and I'm particularly passionate about plain speaking and clear instructions for users with cognitive difficulties.
                        If I'm creating a design system, I ensure that all components, colours, sizes and shapes are AA accessible from the get-go.

                <p>
                    In this role I was responsible for the direction and creation of a new design system for nab.com.au (development work yet to be released).
                    <br><br>
                    This involved leading a small team of designers, as well as leveraging relationships across a plethora of business initiatives, to fight for the unification of design 
                    languages across nab. The outcome of my work throughout the business included the development of a living style guide, with code as the source of truth.
                    <br><br>
                    My day to day involved a heavy mix of hands on design work, stakeholder management, and process innovation - particularly in terms of software and developer 
                    handover advances.

                <p>
                    Outware was an excellent start to my career as a UI designer. With the opportunity to work on the most impactful applications in the country, I learned to craft
                     intuitive user experiences from initial workshops, to designs and development - all the while working alongside a dedicated agile team. 
                     I also developed key soft-skills through working offsite with the client and their internal teams - most notably Mastercard, Transurban, Peoplecare, Suncorp, Coles, ANZ and NAB.

                            it as a team building exercise, and also as something fun to freshen everyone up after a long week of
                            hard design. You can play however you like, but I tend to do either quick battles (everyone gets 5 minutes to Sketch their 
                            idea, then displays to the group), or week's long hi-fidelity challenges.

                            A personal archiving project, when my dad went to sell his large collection of old science fiction novels - some he'd had since he was a kid - I hurried to photograph every single cover. Sadly, I did a <i>very</I> bad job of this (iPhone 4 and terrible lamp anyone?) so for a few years I've been gradually editing and posting the covers.
