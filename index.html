            <h1>about me</h1>

            <p>
                As an Anglo-Australian and Aboriginal woman raised in an environment of cultural erasure, my artistic practice is rooted in the reclamation of identity through making. I work across many mediums — including installation, weaving, sewing, woodcraft, and other tactile practices — but ceramics is my primary mode of expression.
            </p>
            <p>
                I draw visual influence from ancient zoomorphic vessels, such as Peruvian stirrup-spouted vessels, Greek alabastrons, and Egyptian canopic jars, alongside the widespread Aboriginal practice of animal and land personification.
            </p>
            <p>
                Back home, I hand-built ceramic vessels from clays and natural materials foraged from the lands that raised me, and cured them in pit-firings that function as ceremony.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my current work, I have shifted toward materials and symbols tied to the British landscape, including porcelain figures painted in the style of blue transferware and forms made from London brickearth.
