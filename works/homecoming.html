            <p>
                For over 100 years my family has been disconnected from Country, Community, and Culture. The impact of colonisation on our identity was so deeply ingrained that I always felt too afraid to reach out - that I was a fraud for not being able to answer ‚Äúwho‚Äôs your mob, where are you from?‚Äù
                <br><br>
                This Gurrborra (Koala) is a reflection of our journey. It matured under intense stress, leaving it scarred from what it went through - but most importantly, unbroken. Once removed from the fire, it was lovingly repaired and coated in the sap of Garrong, the grandparent plant, to protect it for what‚Äôs to come.
                <br><br>
                Like the Gurrborra, our family is slow to reach our destination, but every day I feel our ancestors pushing me to regain what was kept from us. It doesn‚Äôt matter how long we were lost, as long as we eventually come home.
                <br><br>
                All components were foraged and crafted on Wurundjeri Country, and fired on Boon Wurrung Country - with gratitude.
