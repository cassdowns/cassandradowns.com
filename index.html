                    Cassandra Downs is an Anglo-Australian and Stolen Generations affected woman raised on Wurundjeri Country in Naarm / Melbourne. She maintained an accomplished career in design until 2021, when she opted to take a break and focus on her ceramic art practice. In 2022, she transitioned into conservation and bush remediation, seizing a post-lockdown opportunity to reconnect with Culture and Country as an Aboriginal woman.

                    Now, in 2024, she is eager to reintegrate her diverse experiences into the design world, embracing new challenges and contributing to innovative projects with a focus on sustainable and accessible design.		</p>

                    Cassandra is a self-taught ceramic artist whose zoomorphic vessels explore the impacts of colonisation on the environment and identity of Australia. Her work, deeply rooted in her own generational experiences of cultural erasure, serves as a poignant exploration of resilience and reclaiming heritage.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Her artistic journey is one of resourcefulness and dedication, where she forges her own path from start to finish. From improvising tools to formulating her clay, from mending cracks and infusing lustre with sap, Cassandra invests months of meticulous labor into each vessel. Through the ancient technique of pit-firing, she imbues her sculptures with textured surfaces that whisper tales of resilience and adaptation. Each piece is a testament to her commitment to sustainability and embracing the organic imperfections inherent in the creative process.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In Cassandra's hands, her vessels transcend mere objects; they become vessels of meaning, breathing with life and imbued with a profound connection to both place and time. Through her art, she invites viewers to reflect on the intricate interplay between history, culture, and the enduring spirit of identity.
