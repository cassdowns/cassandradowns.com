                It's been nearly a year since I wrapped up my contract at Nab, and during this time I've focussed primarily on my ceramic arts practice. It's given me a greater insight into the craft of handbuilding, and a deeper connection with my making process.

                    <h3>Design Systems</h3>
                    <p>At the same time that terms such as DesignOps and Design Systems have emerged, 
                        my work has increasingly focussed on achieving consistency and developer parity. I'm most interested
                    in this kind of challenge, creating a solid foundation upon which the creativity of our teams can shine.</p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>I have a tremendous passion for creating design that is accessible to all. From something as simple
                        as ensuring colourblind users can see buttons, all the way to reducing stress for those with mobility impairments.
                        Of particular importance is plain speaking and clear instructions for users with cognitive impairments, which often fits in well with UX practices and common sense.

                <p>
                    In this role, I was responsible for the design direction and creation of a new design system for nab.com.au (development work is ongoing, yet to be released).
                    <br><br>
                    In leading a small team of designers, as well as leveraging relationships across business initiatives, I also fought for a unified design language across nab - including the development of a living style guide, with code as the source of truth.
                    <br><br>
                    My day to day involved a heavy mix of hands on design work, stakeholder management, and process innovation - particularly in terms of software and developer handover advances.

                        An idea created in one night, and added to whenever I think of a new item for the arrays. I've used
                        it as a team building exercise, and also as something fun to freshen everyone up after a long week of
                        hard design. You can play however you like, but I tend to do either quick battles (everyone gets 5 minutes to Sketch their 
                        idea, then displays to the group), or week's long hi-fidelity challenges.
